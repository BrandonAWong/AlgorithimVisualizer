Sorting Algorithims

Bubble Sort

Checks each two adjacent indexes n times and swaps them if the left index is bigger than the right index.
Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Insertion Sort

At each index, loops backwards to find a number smaller than at the current index and swaps them.
Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Selection Sort

At each index, loop through the rest of the list and keep track of the smallest number. At the end of each iteration, swap the current index with the minimum's index.
